<h1>ABOUT (Internet Monitor)</h1>
<p>
    Internet Monitor keeps records of your internet connection. To do so it has a service which is running in the background and will download an internet
    page every 10 seconds and record if it has been successful in downloading it as well as how long time it took and how many bytes has been downloaded.
    Because this service is running in the background even when your phone is in sleeping mode it will use a considerable amount of battery.
    You can enable and disable the service below.
